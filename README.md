# Methylation_analysis

#### 1 Introduction
In this manual I will use the methylKit package. methylKit is an R package for analysis and annotation of DNA methylation information obtained by high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. 

#### 1.1 DNA methylation
DNA methylation in vertebrates typically occurs at CpG dinucleotides, however non-CpG Cs are also methylated in certain tissues such as embryonic stem cells. DNA methylation can act as an epigenetic control mechanism for gene regulation. Methylation can hinder binding of transcription factors and/or methylated bases can be bound by methyl-binding-domain proteins which can recruit chromatin remodeling factors. In both cases, the transcription of the regulated gene will be effected. In addition, aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been associated with many human malignancies and can be used in a predictive manner. In malignant tissues, DNA is either hypo-methylated or hyper-methylated compared to the normal tissue. The location of hyper- and hypo-methylated sites gives a distinct signature to many diseases. Traditionally, hypo-methylation is associated with gene transcription (if it is on a regulatory region such as promoters) and hyper-methylation is associated with gene repression.
